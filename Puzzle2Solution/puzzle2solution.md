This puzzle involes a set of 6 multiple choice questions which all must be solved correctly for the solution to appear.  There is no mention afterwards of which question(s) were answered incorrectly and the player must reanswer all of the questions starting from the first if they get eve none wrong.  

Question 1
----------
Which of these is not the odd one out?

    A. STARLET
    B. SONNET
    C. SAFFRON
    D. SHALLOT
    E. TORRENT
    F. SUGGEST

Solution: The obvious difference is that C starts with a T while all of the  other words start with S.

Question 2
----------

    A. RED
    B. YELLOW
    C. GREEN
    D. BROWN
    E. BLUE
    F. PINK

Solution: When there are colors, the first thought is to see if combinations are occuring however the presence of brown is kind of out of place as brown is not an easily made color on the standard color wheel.
